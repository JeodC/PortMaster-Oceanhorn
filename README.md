# PortMaster Wine - Oceanhorn
This is a port structure to run Oceanhorn through wine64 and box64 via RockNIX on the Retroid Pocket 5 and Retroid Pocket Mini.

## Installation
Copy the `oceanhorn` folder and `Oceanhorn.sh` file to the same place you would normally place your port files e.g. `/roms/ports`. Purchase and install the GOG version and copy all of its data to `oceanhorn/data`.

If you want to set up the emulationstation decorations, copy `cover.png` to the `oceanhorn` folder and copy the contents of `gameinfo.xml` to your `gamelist.xml` file.
